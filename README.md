# 2015-Flight-Delays-Cancellations-Interactive-Power-BI-Dashboard
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing U.S. domestic flight delays and cancellations in 2015. The project evaluates airline performance, airport congestion, delay patterns, and cancellation trends using KPI-driven analytics, drill-through navigation, and multi-page interactive reporting for operational and executive insights.

Project Description
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing U.S. domestic flight delays and cancellations for the year 2015. The objective of the dashboard is to provide both executive-level insights and operational deep-dive analysis using modern business intelligence design principles and KPI-driven storytelling.
The dashboard enables users to explore airline performance, airport congestion, delay patterns, and cancellation trends through interactive visuals, slicers, drill-through navigation, and multi-page report architecture.
